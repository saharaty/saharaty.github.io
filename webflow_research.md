## Implementation Approach

Based on the research, we have two main options for implementing the personal website:

1. **Use Webflow's Platform Directly**:
   - Pros: Native integration with Webflow's CMS, hosting, and features
   - Cons: Requires subscription for full functionality, subject to Webflow's limitations

2. **Create a Custom Implementation**:
   - Pros: Full control over design and functionality, no ongoing subscription costs
   - Cons: Requires more development time, separate hosting solution needed

Given the user's preference for Webflow and the need for a resume and projects showcase, the recommended approach is to:

1. Create a custom HTML/CSS implementation inspired by Webflow templates
2. Host it on a static site platform (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel)
3. Implement the minimal design with specific color scheme as requested
4. Structure the site to include all required sections (resume, projects, academic research, current plans)

This approach provides the clean, professional look of Webflow templates without the platform limitations and subscription costs.
